# Maslow Meets DevEx

_Improving developer experience by taking care of their hierarchy of needs_

When I was kid, I _loved_ playing with LEGOs. Fads like Power Rangers and Pogs (yeah, I was a 90’s kid) would come and go, but from the first birthday I can remember until I was way too old to still be playing with toys, LEGOs were a tried and true pastime.

But the fun of LEGOs isn't really in building them—that's almost like the necessary chore, and actually getting to play is the reward. After all, how many times did you actually take apart a model you'd built, only to build it back from the instructions again?

So, if half of the experience of playing with LEGOs is just a tedious chore disguised as a game, why do we remember LEGOs as being so much fun?

I learned the answer to this question one summer when we were visiting family in California. Their son was heading off to college, and was getting rid of a lot his childhood toys. As a kid who had just recently discovered the almost-endless fun of playing with LEGOs, my eyes lit up when I heard he was giving away his enormous collection of LEGOs. He handed me a big, heavy, blue bucket, and I knew then and there that I was in LEGO heaven. There was just one problem—he had completely dismantled every single set, down to the piece. So instead of being gifted a bunch of already-built toys like I expected, I got a barrel of bricks full of pieces from sets I'd never seen, with no instructions whatsoever.

Little did I know, this shortcoming was the secret to this barrel of fun. This hodgepodge landfill of forgotten pieces would be one of my most played-with toys for the rest of my childhood.

Why? Because without a box in a store telling me what to expect, or a book of instructions telling me what to build, my imagination was free to build whatever it could dream up. This bucket of bricks could manifest itself into endless combinations of characters, vehicles, and scenes, and **I** was at the wheel.
